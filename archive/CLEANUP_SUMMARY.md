# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the Industrial Adam Logger project to improve organization and clarity.

## Latest Cleanup (src/ folder deep clean)
Date: July 31, 2025

### Important Discovery
- Docker uses Industrial.Adam.Logger.Examples which depends on Industrial.Adam.Logger (v1.0)
- Industrial.Adam.Logger.Core (v2.0) is newer but not integrated with Docker
- Created ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION.md to document this confusion

## Archive Structure
Created archive folder with the following structure:
```
archive/
├── test-scripts/      # Test and development scripts
├── coverage-reports/  # Code coverage reports
├── legacy-docs/      # Old documentation files  
├── test-results/     # Test execution results
├── logs/            # Log files
└── old-configs/     # Outdated configuration files
```

## Additional Files Moved in src/ Cleanup

### From src/ folders
- All log files (13 total) moved to `archive/logs/`
- `test_modbus_client.py` and `test_simulators.sh` from Simulator project
- `SimpleTest.cs` from Tests project (trivial test file)
- `Testing/` folder from Industrial.Adam.Logger (unused test infrastructure)
- `appsettings.logging.json` from Industrial.Adam.Logger/Configuration

### Critical Files Restored
- `adam_config_demo.json` and `adam_config_production.json` restored to docker/config/
  (These are required by Docker compose)

### Directories Cleaned
- Removed empty Models/Requests and Models/Responses from WebApi project

### .gitignore Updated
Added entries for:
- Log files (*.log, logs/)
- Test results (TestResults/, coverage files)
- Coverage reports
- Temporary files

## Files Moved to Archive

### Test Scripts (moved to `archive/test-scripts/`)
- `check-registers.py` - Register checking utility
- `simple-modbus-test.py` - Basic Modbus testing
- `test-modbus-connection.py` - Connection testing
- `test-sim2.py`, `test-sim3.py` - Simulator test scripts

### Coverage Reports (moved to `archive/coverage-reports/`)
- `CoverageReport/` - Main coverage report directory
- `CoverageReport-Retry/` - Retry coverage reports
- `TestResults/` - Test results from root
- `coverage-results/` - Additional coverage data

### Legacy Documentation (moved to `archive/legacy-docs/`)
- `INDUSTRIAL_CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Old code review
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Previous refactoring plan
- `TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` - Old test summary
- `adam_logger_csharp.cs` - Legacy C# file

### Configuration Files (moved to `archive/old-configs/`)
- `adam_config_demo.json` - Demo configuration
- `adam_config_production.json` - Production config
- `docker-compose.simulator.yml` - Duplicate docker compose

### Log Files (moved to `archive/logs/`)
- `simulator1.log`, `simulator2.log`, `simulator3.log` - Simulator logs

### Test Results (moved to `archive/test-results/`)
- `IntegrationTests/` - Integration test results

## Current Project Structure
The cleaned project now has a more organized structure:

### Root Directory
- Core documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- Main solution file
- Docker configurations
- Essential scripts only

### Source Code (`src/`)
- Clean project structure without test results
- No orphaned log files
- Clear separation of concerns

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- Current and relevant documentation only
- Technical specifications
- Development guides

## Benefits of Cleanup
1. **Improved Navigation** - Easier to find relevant files
2. **Cleaner Git Status** - Less clutter in version control
3. **Clear Purpose** - Each directory has a specific purpose
4. **Preserved History** - All files archived, not deleted

## Next Steps
- Review archived files periodically
- Consider adding `.gitignore` entries for generated files
- Maintain clean structure going forward
