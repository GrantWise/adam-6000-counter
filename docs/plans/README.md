- `master-implementation-timeline.md` - Original 16-week timeline
- `complete-system-architecture.md` - Exhaustive architecture analysis  
- `module-quality-remediation-plan.md` - Earlier cleanup approach

These are kept for reference but are superseded by the current MASTER-PLAN.md.

## Quick Start

1. **Read MASTER-PLAN.md** for the complete picture
2. **Reference supporting documents** for technical details as needed
