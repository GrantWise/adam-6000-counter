# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## ADAM Counter Logger Frontend

### 1. Overview

The ADAM Counter Logger Frontend is a web-based configuration and monitoring interface for industrial technicians to manage ADAM-6000 series counter devices. These devices are industrial-grade hardware modules that count electrical pulses from production equipment, quality gates, conveyor systems, and other manufacturing machinery.

**What are Industrial Counters?**
Industrial counters track production metrics by counting electrical pulses. For example:
- A bottle filling line sends a pulse each time a bottle passes a sensor
- A quality inspection station sends pulses for "passed" and "failed" items
- A packaging machine counts completed packages

The ADAM-6000 devices connect to these pulse sources and communicate the count values over Ethernet using the Modbus TCP protocol, an industry-standard for industrial automation.

**Design Philosophy**
This frontend prioritizes direct access to all features without wizards or progressive disclosure, designed for experienced technicians who need full control and visibility. Every setting and feature is immediately accessible - no hunting through menus or multi-step processes.

- API response time: < 500ms for reads, < 1s for writes
- Real-time update latency: < 100ms
- Support 50+ simultaneous device configurations
- Handle 1000+ counter updates per second
- Smooth UI with 60fps interactions

### 9. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling designed for industrial environments where downtime is costly.

**Network Errors:**
- **Automatic Retry**: System attempts reconnection automatically
  - First retry: After 1 second
  - Second retry: After 2 seconds
  - Third retry: After 4 seconds (exponential backoff)
  - Prevents network flooding while maintaining responsiveness
- **User Notification**: Toast showing "Connection lost, retrying..."
- **Manual Override**: "Retry Now" button for immediate attempt

**Validation Errors:**
- **Real-time Validation**: Errors appear as you type
- **Field-level Messages**: Error appears directly under problem field
- **Examples**:
  - "IP address must be in format XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
  - "Port must be between 1 and 65535"
  - "Register count must match data type (2 for UInt32)"
- **Prevention**: Invalid inputs highlighted in red
- **Guidance**: Tooltip with correct format/range

**System Errors:**
- **Toast Notifications**: Pop-up messages in corner of screen
- **Severity Levels**:
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info: "Configuration saved successfully"
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: "High memory usage detected"
  - ‚ùå Error: "Failed to write to database"
- **Actionable Messages**: Each error includes what to do
  - Bad: "Error 500"
  - Good: "Database connection failed. Check InfluxDB is running."

**Connection Failures:**
- **Visual Status**: Device row highlighted in red
- **Status Icon**: üî¥ with hover showing last error
- **Quick Actions**:
  - "Test Connection": Run diagnostic
  - "View Logs": See detailed error history
  - "Edit Settings": Adjust timeout/retries
- **Automatic Recovery**: If enabled, shows retry countdown

**Data Conflicts:**
- **Scenario**: Two users edit same device simultaneously
- **Detection**: System tracks configuration versions
- **Resolution Options**:
  - "Use Mine": Override with your changes
  - "Use Theirs": Accept other user's changes
  - "Merge": Show differences and manually resolve
- **Prevention**: Warning when opening already-being-edited device

**Structured Error Display Format:**

Each error shows four sections (expandable):

1. **Summary** (Always visible):
   - Plain English description
   - Example: "Cannot connect to Production Line Counter"

2. **Error Classification**:
   - **Type**: Connection/Configuration/Data/System
   - **Severity**: Critical/Warning/Info
   - **Code**: For support reference (e.g., "CONN_TIMEOUT_001")
   - **Component**: What part failed (e.g., "ModbusClient")

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - Numbered checklist of things to try
   - Example for connection error:
     1. ‚úì Verify device is powered on
     2. ‚úì Check network cable is connected
     3. ‚úì Ping device IP address (click to test)
     4. ‚úì Verify firewall allows port 502
     5. ‚úì Check device configuration matches

4. **Technical Details** (Collapsed by default):
   - Stack trace for developers
   - Raw error message
   - Timestamp and context
   - Device configuration at time of error
   - Network diagnostics

**Recovery Actions:**
Each error includes relevant action buttons:
- "Retry Operation"
- "Test Connection"
- "View Documentation"
- "Contact Support" (pre-fills error details)
- "Ignore and Continue" (where safe)

### 10. Data Management

**Configuration Versioning with Rollback**

Every configuration change is automatically versioned, like "track changes" in a document:

- **Version History List**: Shows all past configurations
  - Version number, date/time, who changed, what changed
  - Example: "v23 - 2024-01-15 14:30 - John - Added Line 3 Counter"
- **Compare Versions**: See differences between any two versions
  - Red = Removed, Green = Added, Yellow = Modified
- **Rollback Function**: One-click restore to any previous version
  - Confirmation dialog shows what will change
  - Creates new version (doesn't delete history)
- **Comments**: Optional note explaining why change was made

**Bulk Import/Export of Device Configurations**

- **Export Formats**:
  - **JSON**: Complete configuration with all settings
  - **CSV**: Simplified format for Excel editing
  - **ZIP**: Includes configs + documentation

- **Export Options**:
  - All devices or selected devices only
  - Include channel configurations
  - Include global settings
